# pi-clean-mode

`pi-clean-mode` collapses a whole agent run into a single duration header, leaving only the final answer in the transcript. Press the toggle key (default `f2`) to expand the work again.

## What it changes

One user prompt usually runs the agent through many tool calls and several narration paragraphs before the final answer. By default Pi renders all of it. This package treats everything except the final answer as **work** and collapses it:

```
[user message]

Took 4m 26s ›
The cause was that today's restock used stock-sales from two days ago, so demand was underestimated.
```

Expanded, the transcript looks exactly like Pi's normal output.

## How the work/final split is decided

Pi exports its transcript components, so this package replaces `AssistantMessageComponent.render` and `ToolExecutionComponent.render` on the prototype:

| Component | Collapsed behaviour |
|---|---|
| Assistant message **with** tool calls | hidden entirely (narration belongs to the work) |
| Assistant message **without** tool calls | kept, with the duration header prepended |
| Tool row | hidden entirely |

A message without tool calls is the final answer because the agent loop only ends once a response has no tool calls left, so there is exactly one such message per run.

Hidden rows render zero lines, so the duration header lands directly above the final answer.

## Live behaviour

The transcript stays expanded while the agent is running — otherwise a collapsed run would show nothing until the answer arrives. When the run settles (`agent_settled`) the work collapses automatically. Automatic collapsing is suppressed for the rest of the run if you toggled the state yourself.

## Commands and shortcuts

| Trigger | Effect |
|---|---|
| `f2` | Collapse or expand the current run's work |
| `/clean` | Same as the shortcut |
| `/config:clean-mode` | Print the current configuration |
| `/config:clean-mode <key>=on\|off` | Change one boolean setting and save it |

## Configuration

Config file: `<pi agent dir>/extensions/pi-clean-mode/config.json`. See `config.example.json`.

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "autoExpandWhileRunning": true,
  "showRunHeader": true,
  "showExpandHint": true
}
```

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `enabled` | Master switch. When off, every patch passes the original render through untouched. |
| `autoExpandWhileRunning` | Expand while running, then collapse when the run settles. |
| `showRunHeader` | Show the `Took …` header above the final answer. |
| `showExpandHint` | Append the expand hint to the header. |

## Compatibility

This package patches Pi component prototypes, so it is coupled to Pi's exported component surface (`AssistantMessageComponent.hasToolCalls`, `ToolExecutionComponent.render`, and the empty-render-means-zero-lines behaviour). It restores the original prototypes on reload and shutdown, and refuses to overwrite a prototype that another extension replaced after install.

`f2` was chosen because Pi's built-in keybindings do not use it. If you rebind Pi keys, avoid colliding with it.
